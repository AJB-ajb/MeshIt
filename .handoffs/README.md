# Handoffs

Self-contained task briefs for delegating work to parallel Claude Code sessions.

## Usage

1. Copy-paste the contents of a handoff file into a new Claude Code session
2. Provide `.env` separately (not in git)
3. The agent clones the repo, works on a feature branch, pushes when done
4. Merge the branch back into `dev` after review
