-- Fix private postings RLS: restrict visibility of private postings
-- Previously the "Open postings are viewable" policy allowed any authenticated
-- user to see any posting with status='open'. Private postings should only be
-- visible to the owner, invited users, or accepted applicants.

-- Drop the old permissive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Open postings are viewable" ON public.postings;

-- Create a new policy that checks visibility
CREATE POLICY "Postings are viewable based on visibility"
  ON public.postings
