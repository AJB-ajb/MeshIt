            Review this PR. Be critical and concise. Focus on:
            1. Correctness — logic bugs, edge cases, null checks
            2. Integration — conflicts with recent changes to shared files
            3. Supabase — migration ordering, RLS policies, client usage
            4. Patterns — consistency with project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
            5. Tests — are new code paths tested?

            Skip style/formatting comments (ESLint handles that).
            Only comment on issues that matter.
