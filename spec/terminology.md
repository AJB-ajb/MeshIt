# Terminology

Canonical reference for all user-facing terminology in Mesh. When implementing UI labels, spec updates, or translations, always refer to this document.

See also: [mesh.md](mesh.md) (product overview), [ux.md](ux.md) (UX spec), [matching.md](matching.md) (matching algorithm).

## Translation Note

We include reasoning behind each term so that when translating to other languages, the translator (human or LLM) can translate the _meaning_ and intent, not just the literal words.

## Resolved Decisions

### Posting (not "Project")

Use "posting" throughout.

"Project" implies something structured or long-term. "Posting" is more general and encompasses opportunities, activities, events, tasks, and spontaneous plans. We don't want to specialize too much — many postings might not be full projects.

- **Attribution**: Use "Posted by {name}" (not "Created by").

### Connections (not "Friends" or "Contacts")

Use "connections" for relationships between users.

"Friends" is too casual and implies personal closeness that may not exist between people who met through a posting. "Contacts" is transactional and feels more like an address book. "Connections" is non-hierarchical, neutral, well-understood, and covers the full range of relationship depth.

### Join / Request to join (not "Apply" or "I'm Interested")

The primary CTA depends on a per-posting `auto_accept` setting:

- **"Join"** — when `auto_accept` is true (instant, no approval step). Default for connection-scoped or sequential invite postings.
- **"Request to join"** — when `auto_accept` is false (requires poster approval). Default for open/global postings.

"Apply" implies hierarchy and a formal selection process, which contradicts the collaborative, non-hierarchical ethos. "I'm Interested" is too passive and doesn't commit the user to action. "Join" / "Request to join" is active, inclusive, and sets the right expectation based on whether approval is needed.

#### Cascading label changes

| Old                         | New                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Applications                | Join Requests                |
| Submit Application          | Request to join              |
| Application Pending         | Request pending              |
| Application Sent            | Request sent                 |
| Applied to {posting}        | Requested to join {posting}  |
| New application from {name} | New join request from {name} |
| Withdraw                    | Withdraw request             |
| Not Selected                | Keep as-is (good euphemism)  |
| Accepted / Declined         | Keep as-is                   |

### Invite (sequential + parallel)

Use "Invite" in UI and specs. Two sub-modes:

- **Sequential**: invites sent one-by-one in ranked order until someone accepts. The next connection is auto-invited on decline.
- **Parallel**: all selected connections invited at once. First to accept wins.

"Friend Ask" was informal jargon — replaced with "Invite" for clarity. The user chooses the mode via a toggle when creating an invite.

- **DB column**: `mode: "friend_ask"` is being replaced by `visibility: "private"` (expand-contract migration). During the transition, both columns exist; code reads `visibility` and writes both.

### Visibility (not "Mode")

Use "Visibility" for the public/private toggle on postings.

- **Public**: the posting appears in Discover for anyone to find and request to join.
- **Private**: the posting is invite-only. The poster invites connections directly.

Previously called `mode: "open" | "friend_ask"`, which was confusing. The new `visibility` column uses clear, well-understood terminology. Invites are decoupled from visibility — you can invite connections on any posting, regardless of visibility.

### Relevance (not "Semantic" or "Semantic similarity")

Use "Relevance" in match score breakdowns.

"Semantic" and "Semantic similarity" are technical ML terms. "Relevance" is intuitive and covers topic alignment, intent matching, and context similarity.

### Flexible (not "Either" for location mode)

Use "Flexible" as the third location option (alongside Remote and In-person).

"Either" is vague — does it mean "I truly don't care" or "I'm open to both"? "Flexible" communicates openness clearly.

### Bookmarks (separate page)

Move saved/bookmarked postings from the Matches page to a dedicated `/bookmarks` page with its own sidebar nav item.

The Matches page was overloaded with three unrelated sections (AI Matches, Interests Received, My Interests). "Bookmarks" is a well-understood pattern (save for later) that doesn't imply commitment to the poster.

### Repost + Extend Deadline (not "Reactivate")

Replace the single "Reactivate" button with two distinct buttons for expired postings:

- **"Repost"** — creates a fresh version of the posting (resets join requests, bumps to top of feed)
- **"Extend Deadline"** — pushes the deadline forward on the existing posting (keeps existing join requests)

These are fundamentally different actions. A single "Reactivate" label doesn't communicate which behavior the user will get.

### Deadline + Activity date (not "Urgency / Expiry")

Split into two distinct fields:

- **"Deadline"** — when the posting closes to new join requests
- **"Activity date"** (optional) — when the activity or project starts

A posting might close in 2 days but be for an event 3 weeks away. These are different concepts.

### Collaboration preferences (not "Collaboration style" or "Work Style Preference")

Standardize on "Collaboration preferences" for both person-level defaults and posting-level overrides.

The spec previously used "Work Style Preference" (person dimensions) and "Collaboration style" (posting fields) for the same concept. One term avoids confusion.

### Categories (simplified)

Use short, clean category names: `Study`, `Hackathon`, `Personal`, `Professional`, `Social`.

The spec previously used slash-separated variants ("Hackathon/Competition", "Personal/Side", "Social/Leisure") but the code already uses the simpler forms.

### Waitlist

When a posting is filled, users can join a waitlist for automatic or manual promotion when a spot opens.

- **"Join waitlist"** — CTA shown on filled auto-accept postings
- **"Request to join waitlist"** — CTA shown on filled manual-review postings
- **"Waitlisted"** — Status badge for users on the waitlist
- **"You are #N on the waitlist"** — Position indicator shown to waitlisted users

---

### Team size

Team size always includes the posting creator. Minimum team size is 2 (creator + at least one other person).

- **`team_size_min`**: Minimum total members including the creator. The Project tab unlocks when `accepted_count + 1 >= team_size_min`.
- **`team_size_max`**: Maximum total members including the creator. The posting is marked "filled" when `accepted_count + 1 >= team_size_max`.
- Display: show `accepted_count + 1` (to include the creator) in team fill indicators.

## Open Questions

- **Persona selection** ("developer" / "posting creator"): Unclear what these mean. Contradicts "no required configuration" principle if required during onboarding. Needs clarification or removal.
- **"Matches" page name**: With Bookmarks and Join Requests moved elsewhere, this page is now just AI recommendations. Consider renaming to "Recommended" or "For You."
