# Matching

## Overview

This document defines how users and postings are matched based on compatibility. The goal is not perfect matching — just better than random chance.

### Design Principles

- **Continuous scales over enums**: Prefer continuous scales with reference points instead of enums
  - Enums need to be extended and predefined, which is inflexible and hard to maintain
- **Principled categories**: Even if factor evaluation is subjective, we define reference points for consistent values across users
- **Natural language input**: Most configuration can be done via natural language (transformed to structured values via AI)
  - Handoff markdown available for fast exchange to other platforms
- **Hierarchical defaults**: Most configuration is on the person-level, with posting-level overrides. Postings can also inherit defaults from other postings.
- **Gradual scoring**: Extrema values are handled gracefully (e.g., strong in-person preference still matches reasonably with slight remote preference)
- **Good enough matching**: We cover common cases well; edge cases can be handled manually or by AI. Looking through ten people is acceptable if the top matches are good enough.

### Core Approach

- Weighted filters per user
- Compatibility = combined scores across dimensions
- Two-stage database filtering using Supabase (PostgreSQL):
  1. Fast filtering using indexed tables (context identifiers, category, location)
  2. Soft scoring on remaining candidates
- Semantic matching via pgvector for embedding similarity (posting descriptions, tags, natural language criteria)
- Keep raw inputs (e.g., "prefer Monday evening") for user editing and display

### User Experience

- Users can see where they differ in preferences to understand compatibility better
- Users can see how certain alignment is, based on missing data

## Dimensions

### Person Dimensions

#### Skill Level

Self-assessed skill level (0-10 scale, slider input):

- Separate per domain
- Domains are hierarchical (e.g., programming > web development > frontend), extrapolates missing levels if necessary
- Reference points:
  - 1-2: Beginner, learning fundamentals
  - 3-4: Can follow tutorials, build simple things with guidance
  - 5-6: Intermediate, can work independently on typical tasks
  - 7-8: Advanced, professional-level, can mentor others
  - 9-10: Expert, deep expertise, recognized in field

#### Work Style Preference

Preferred collaboration mode (person-level default, can be overridden per posting):

- **Collaboration intensity** (0-10 scale): From fully independent to constant joint work
- **Preferred activities**: Pair programming, whiteboarding, async review, brainstorming, etc.

This is one of the most significant interpersonal differences in collaborative work (see [vision.md](vision.md)).

#### Location Mode

Where collaboration or activity happens (person-level default, can be overridden per posting):

- **Remote**: Fully online
- **In-person**: Must be physically present
- **Flexible**: No strong preference

#### Availability

See [availability-calendar.md](availability-calendar.md) for the full availability spec including minute-level windows, calendar sync, and overlap scoring.

### Posting Dimensions

- **Title**: Name of the posting
- **Description**: Used for semantic matching via pgvector embeddings
- **Category**:
  - Coarse categories (for fast filtering): Study, Hackathon, Personal, Professional, Social
  - Free-form tags/keywords (matched via overlap or pgvector embedding similarity)
- **Context identifier**: Specific hackathon name, course code, etc. (exact string match filter)
- **Natural language criteria**: Optional, stored as pgvector embeddings for semantic matching beyond structured dimensions
- **Capacity**: How many people the poster is looking for (default: 1)
- **Deadline**: When the posting closes to new join requests
- **Activity date**: When the activity or project starts (optional)
- **Mode**: Open (anyone can join or request to join) vs. Sequential Invite (ordered invites sent one-by-one until enough accept)
- **Auto-accept**: Per-posting boolean. When true, the CTA is "Join" (instant). When false, the CTA is "Request to join" (requires poster approval). Default: true for connection-scoped postings, false for open/global postings.
- **Remote preference**: Remote, in-person, or flexible (overrides person-level default)
- **Location**: Where the activity happens (overrides person-level default)
- **Max distance**: Maximum distance for in-person activities (km)
- **Person dimension overrides**: Posting-specific overrides of person-level defaults (e.g., skill level requirement, work style)
- **Defaults from other postings**: A posting can inherit defaults from a previous posting to reduce repeated setup

#### Optional Posting Fields

- **Collaboration preferences**: Intensity (0-10) and preferred activities (pair programming, brainstorming, async review, etc.) — relevant for project-type postings (overrides person-level work style preference)
- **Estimated time**: How much time the activity or project requires (e.g., "2 hours", "10-20h/week for 4 weeks")

### Waitlist

When a posting is filled (accepted count + creator >= `team_size_max`), additional users can join a waitlist. Always available on filled postings — no per-posting toggle.

#### Behavior

- **Joining**: Users who join or request to join a filled posting are automatically waitlisted (status: `waitlisted`)
- **Ordering**: Waitlist is ordered by join time (FIFO — first come, first served)
- **Spot opens**: When an accepted collaborator withdraws or is removed:
  - **Auto-accept posting**: First waitlisted person is instantly promoted to accepted
  - **Manual review posting**: Poster receives notification; can accept or skip waitlisted people
- **Visibility**: Waitlisted users see their position ("You are #3 on the waitlist")
- **Withdrawal**: Waitlisted users can withdraw at any time

#### Status transitions

- `waitlisted` → `accepted` (auto-promote or poster accepts)
- `waitlisted` → `withdrawn` (user withdraws)
- `accepted` → `withdrawn` (triggers waitlist promotion)

#### Edge cases

- Poster manually reopens a filled posting → waitlisted users stay waitlisted (no auto-promote since posting isn't over-capacity)
- Poster reposts → resets everything (waitlisted users are cleared)
- Posting expires → waitlisted users are notified and removed from the waitlist
- Multiple spots open simultaneously → promote in FIFO order

#### Application statuses (updated)

`pending | accepted | rejected | withdrawn | waitlisted`

## Compatibility Scoring

### Two-Stage Matching

#### Stage 1: Hard Filters (Pass/Fail)

- Context identifier (exact match if specified)
- Category (if filtered)
- Skill level minimum (if specified)
- Location mode (if hard constraint, e.g., "in-person only")
- Time/date overlap (does the person's availability overlap with the posting's time at all?)

#### Stage 2: Soft Scoring (0-1 Scale)

Remaining dimensions combined via weighted average.

### Compatibility Formula

**Weighted average**: `score = Σ(sᵢ × wᵢ) / Σwᵢ`

Where:

- `sᵢ` = score for dimension i (0-1)
- `wᵢ` = weight for dimension i

With fewer dimensions than a complex project-matching system, a weighted average is more appropriate than a geometric mean — it avoids one low dimension disproportionately tanking the overall score.

### Dimension Weights

User-configurable with defaults:

| Dimension            | Default Weight |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Relevance            | 1.0            |
| Availability overlap | 1.0            |
| Skill level          | 0.7            |
| Location preference  | 0.7            |

Users can adjust weights to reflect their priorities.

### Per-Dimension Score Formulas

| Dimension            | Score Formula                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Relevance            | pgvector cosine similarity of posting description embeddings                |
| Availability overlap | Fraction of requested time slots that overlap with candidate's availability |
| Skill level          | `1 -                                                                        | levelA - levelB | / 10` (or complementarity score) |
| Location preference  | 1.0 if compatible, 0.5 if partial match, 0.0 if incompatible                |

## Technical Implementation

### Database: Supabase + pgvector

- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for all structured data storage and queries
- **pgvector** extension for embedding storage and similarity search
- Embeddings stored for: posting descriptions, tags, natural language criteria
- Fast filtering via PostgreSQL indexes, semantic matching via pgvector cosine similarity

### AI Input Processing

Natural language inputs are transformed to structured values via AI:

- Prompt a model to extract structured values from natural language inputs, given the data model
- Generate embeddings for semantic fields and store in pgvector
- Examples: "weekends, 10-20h/week" → structured time and availability data
