## Example Postings

New spec: 
- Idea-based social platform for quickly asking people to do stuff together and finding people on an idea/project level.
    - Goals: 
      - Minimize friction for finding random people fast
      - Minimize back-and-forth messaging
      - Maximize matching efficiency (speed, success).
      - should allow meeting new people effectively with idea focus
      
These examples illustrate the variety of matching scenarios:

- "AI safety project, Master's level, preference for pair programming, Hamburg, weekends, 10-20h/week, preferred hours 18-22"
- "Theatre project, 4 weeks, all skill levels, evenings/weekends"
- "Course project collaborator, in-person, weekends, 2h direct collaboration"
- "Negotiation practice partner, online, today, 16+"
- "Hackathon teammate for the XHacks hackathon, any skill level, remote, full weekend, posting till in 2 days"
- "Course project partner for data-structures and algorithms, collaboration style: no collaboration, just handing in together, 2+h/week, any skill level"
- "Going for a classical concert some time this week, searching for a local companion with experience"
- "Looking for a tennis partner for weekend matches, intermediate level, Hamburg area"

## Use Cases
- Case: I want to do something together with exactly one friend. I need to ask one friend. If this friend isn't available, I ask another friend. This requires significant back-and-forth messaging.
  - This is a fundamental problem emerging when searching for a limited number of people (here: 1) in a larger group (here: friends).
  - 'Ordering friends' might seem weird, but it is a natural way to express preference that is already used in many contexts. 
  - Functionality: "Ask a friend"; Select and order people to ask; Send requests one by one until one accepts or all decline.

- Case: I want to do something together with exactly one person, but I don't have a specific person in mind. I want to find a suitable person from a larger group (e.g., colleagues, classmates, community members).
