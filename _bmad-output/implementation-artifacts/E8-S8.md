# Story 8.8: Accessibility Audit

**Epic:** E8 - UI/UX  
**Status:** ready-for-dev  
**Priority:** P1  
**Dependencies:** All E8 stories, All functional stories  
**Blocks:** None

## Story

As a user with accessibility needs,
I want the app to be fully accessible,
so that I can use it regardless of my abilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I use a screen reader
   **When** I navigate the app
   **Then** all content is announced correctly
   **And** interactive elements have proper labels

2. **Given** I use keyboard only
   **When** I navigate the app
   **Then** I can access all features
   **And** focus indicators are visible

3. **Given** I have color blindness
   **When** I view the app
   **Then** information is not conveyed by color alone
   **And** contrast ratios meet WCAG AA

4. **Given** I use screen magnification
   **When** I zoom to 200%
   **Then** the layout remains usable
   **And** no content is cut off
