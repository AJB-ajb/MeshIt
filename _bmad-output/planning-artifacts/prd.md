# Product Requirements Document - MeshIt

**Author:** IBK  
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Version:** 1.0 (Expedited)

---

## Executive Summary

**MeshIt** is an AI-powered project collaboration matching platform that connects people with complementary skills and interests for small team projects (2-5 people). Unlike existing tools (Slack, Discord, Meetup) that require manual searching and random team formation, MeshIt uses **semantic embeddings** to understand what users bring and what projects need — then matches them intelligently.

**Core Differentiator:** Natural language in → AI-powered semantic matching out. Users describe themselves and their projects in plain language; the system does the rest.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### The Pain
Finding collaborators for projects today requires high effort:
- Scanning Slack/WhatsApp channels manually
- Posting "looking for X" messages that get lost
- Large communities don't scale for individual matching
- Skill levels and personal compatibility are never explicit
- Teams form randomly; projects stall or fail due to mismatch

### The Gap
Existing tools match on surface-level signals (job title, programming language) or don't match at all. Nobody is understanding **how someone works**, what problems they solve, or whether they're compatible with a specific project's needs.

### The Opportunity
If we can deeply understand what someone brings (via their description + optional signals like GitHub) and what a project needs, we can match the right people to the right projects — fast.

---

## 2. Product Vision

**Tagline:** *"Stop posting 'looking for teammates' in Slack. Let AI find your perfect match."*

### Vision Statement
MeshIt makes finding collaborators as easy as describing what you need. Post a project in plain language, and within seconds, see the 3-5 people most likely to be a great fit — with explanations of why they matched.

### Success Looks Like
- A hackathon participant posts "Building an AI-powered recipe app, need someone good at mobile UI" and gets matched with the right person in under 30 seconds
- A student finds course project partners without scrolling through 200 Discord messages
- Teams that form through MeshIt have higher completion rates than random teams

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Personas

| Persona | Description | Key Needs |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Hackathon Hannah** | Participating in hackathons, needs teammates fast | Speed, skill matching, availability alignment |
| **Student Sam** | Finding course project partners | Location/schedule compatibility, skill level matching |
| **Side-Project Pete** | Has an idea, needs collaborators | Finding people excited about the same problem domain |
| **Mentor Maria** | Wants to help others learn | Finding mentees at the right skill level |

### Secondary Personas
- Event organizers (bulk team formation)
- Open source maintainers (finding contributors)

### NOT Target Users (Initially)
- Large enterprises with formal recruiting processes
- Long-term employment matching (this is project-focused)

---

## 4. Core Features (MVP Scope)

### 4.1 User Onboarding & Profile
- **One-click OAuth** (Google) — no forms, no friction
- **Natural language profile creation**: User describes themselves in 30 seconds of text/voice
  - "I'm a backend developer with 3 years of Python experience, interested in AI and healthcare tech. I prefer async collaboration and can commit 10-15 hours/week."
- **AI extracts structured data** from description:
  - Skills, interests, availability, collaboration style, experience level
- **Profile embeddings generated** for matching

### 4.2 Project Posting
- **Natural language project creation**: Paste from Slack/WhatsApp or describe in text/voice
  - "Building a Minecraft-style collaborative IDE, need 2-3 people with WebGL or game dev experience, hackathon this weekend"
- **AI extracts**:
  - Required skills, team size, timeline, commitment level
- **Project embeddings generated** for matching

### 4.3 Matching Engine
- **Embedding-based semantic matching**:
  - Profile embeddings ↔ Project embeddings
  - Cosine similarity search
- **Match results**: Top 3-5 candidates per project
- **Match explanations**: Why this person matched (generated by LLM)

### 4.4 Match Interaction
- **Project creators** see match cards with:
  - Profile summary
  - Match score (e.g., 87%)
  - Why they matched
  - "Invite" button
- **Contributors** see projects they matched with:
  - Project description
  - Why they're a fit
  - "Apply" or "Decline"

### 4.5 Messaging
- Basic instant messaging between matched users
- Ability to share external links (WhatsApp, Discord, Slack) for continued collaboration

### 4.6 Notifications
- Match notifications (push/email)
- Daily digest for non-urgent matches

---

## 5. Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP)

| Feature | Description | Value |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **GitHub Integration** | Analyze repos/commits for deeper developer skill understanding | Better technical matching for devs |
| **Voice Explanations** | ElevenLabs audio of why someone matched | Unique UX differentiator |
| **Collaboration Style Analysis** | Hume AI analysis of communication patterns | Match on working style, not just skills |
| **Calendar Integration** | Auto-suggest time slots based on availability | Reduce scheduling friction |
| **Rating System** | Post-project reviews (objective, not reputation-gaming) | Trust building |

---

## 6. User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Onboarding
```
Landing page → "Sign up with Google" → OAuth
        ↓
"Tell us about yourself" (text box or voice button)
        ↓
AI processes → Shows extracted profile preview
        ↓
"Looks good!" → Profile saved → Dashboard
```

### Flow 2: Post a Project
```
Dashboard → "Post Project"
        ↓
Text box: "Describe your project and who you need"
(or paste from Slack/WhatsApp)
        ↓
AI extracts → Preview project details
        ↓
Confirm → Project live → Matching begins
        ↓
See matches in ~10-30 seconds
```

### Flow 3: Receive & Accept Match
```
Notification: "You matched with a project!"
        ↓
View project details + why you matched
        ↓
"Apply" → Creator notified
        ↓
Creator accepts → Collaboration starts
        ↓
Messaging unlocked
```

## 12. Open Questions for Architect

1. **Vector DB choice**: Qdrant vs Pinecone vs pgvector? Trade-offs for hackathon timeline?
2. **Embedding model**: text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI) vs alternatives? Cost vs quality?
3. **Real-time updates**: WebSocket for live match updates or polling?
4. **Background jobs**: Celery/Redis or Vercel serverless functions?
5. **LangChain necessity**: Is full LangChain needed or simpler direct API calls sufficient for MVP?
