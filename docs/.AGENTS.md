# docs/ Directory Index

Reference documentation for the MeshIt project. Keep files concise and LLM-optimized.

## Files

## Conventions

- Target audience: LLMs and developers. Favor tables and structured data over prose.
- Keep files under 250 lines. If a file grows beyond that, split or trim.
- No code examples unless they show a pattern that isn't obvious from the source.
